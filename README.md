# Generalized Probabilistic Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning (GPFRL)
This code is my early attempt at creating neuro-fuzzy networks following the approach outlined in:

W. M. Hinojosa, S. Nefti and U. Kaymak, "Systems Control With Generalized Probabilistic Fuzzy-Reinforcement Learning," in IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 51-64, Feb. 2011, doi: 10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2081994.

This repository is made publicly available for others to build on top of, but use with caution, as since this was my work from the beginning of my Ph.D., there may be mistakes as I was still learning about fuzzy logic at the time.
